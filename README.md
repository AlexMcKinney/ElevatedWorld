#Elevated World Visual
A visual simulator for the results of the Elevated World neural networking AI project.  
It is given a neural networking via input file specs that determines the behavior of the agent/s in the environment.

##Environment
A mouse is using sight and sound to eat Food (green), avoid Poison (red), and ignore Neutral (blue) blocks.
Its neural network has learned to recognize patterns of what to seek and avoid via past simulations.

##Controls
User controls are just to observe the simulation.  WASD and arrow keys for camera movement.  
**p**: pause environment (can still move camera, etc)
**v**: disable/enable visualizer (environment continues without visual updates)
**x**: print debugger
**y**: toggle camera follow aim
**h**: toggle camera follow eye
**7**: slowest timestep speed
**8**: slow timestep speed
**9**: faster timestep speed
**0**: fastest timestep speed (default)
